# 💰 Frontend Mentor - Tip Calculator App Solution

This is my solution to the [Tip Calculator App challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX).
Frontend Mentor challenges help developers improve their front-end skills by building realistic projects and applying best practices in design, accessibility, and performance.

## 🧭 Overview

### 🎯 The challenge

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device’s screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements
* Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## 🧠 My Process

### 🏗️ Built With

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS Custom Properties**
* **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout
* **Mobile-first workflow**
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity
* **BEM naming convention** for maintainable structure

---

### 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me understand how **JavaScript logic can transform a static interface into a real-time calculator**.
By handling live input events and validating form data, I learned how to:

* Manage state efficiently without frameworks
* Create smooth and accessible error feedback for users
* Use CSS and JS together to reflect real-time calculation changes

The project also reinforced the importance of **accessibility** (ARIA labels, `aria-live` regions, keyboard focus states) and **secure, standards-based HTML structure**.

---

### 🔄 Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

* Modularizing JavaScript for better scalability
* Adding automated accessibility testing (e.g. using Axe or Lighthouse)
* Exploring frameworks like React or Svelte for UI state management
